This summer, my main goal was really to attain a balance between work and life. As I tried to experience a preview of what graduate school might look like, I experimented with setting boundaries between the two, making sure that I got the best of both worlds.

Less than two months ago, I wrapped up my research internship at MIT. The whole week was filled with last-minute experiments, presentations, farewell meals with people, and a boat cruise with the entire cohort of 98 summer research interns. It felt unreal that everything was coming to an end, especially as someone who had adjusted well to the Boston/Cambridge area and its people.

I was given the chance to present my research to the entire Media Arts and Sciences department. Multiple professors and graduate students from several labs were there to listen. It was indeed exhilarating, but I am proud of myself for taking this endeavor as an opportunity to educate others about the drought experience in Angola and communicate how my research identifies the most vulnerable areas from a multidimensional perspective.

After the presentation, I was surprised by the feedback I received.

*“How do you have such confidence? I wish I had some of that.” “You did really well and presented it very clearly to your audience.”* It didn’t occur to me that I exuded such an aura. I usually just take these things lightly because of my experience hosting events within the Filipino Students Association at Duke and because I enjoyed my work for the most part and wanted to be as clear as possible in representing millions of Angolans.

*“The slides are well-prepared—you should work in marketing…”* You can be the judge of this, but as someone who enjoys design and communication, I try to convey information in the most digestible way possible.

Apart from this, I was fortunate to also be given the chance to communicate my work to a major stakeholder in Angola—Zolana Joao, the head of the Angolan Space Agency. I think it was the culmination of my summer project since in my mind, the research has always been for them. I will only count my work as a success when I have presented my insights to those who will benefit from it. In this sense, it was a success on my end, especially hearing encouraging words from him, *“Most of your results make sense—congratulations!”*

More than the research, I would say that I was also able to enjoy life, in general. During the times when I was not in the lab, I promised myself to invest in myself, friendships, and professional acquaintances. I explored the coffee shops in Cambridge journaling about my life and career. I ran along the scenic Charles River and Boston Esplanade a few times. I also played volleyball with some of my fellow interns and Bostonians we met.

*It became my habit of going to Flour Bakery and Café along Mass. Ave. early morning before going to work at 8:30 am.*

I am beyond thankful for this opportunity that MIT has provided me with. I learned a lot work- and life-wise. Although it was not always a balance, I am proud of myself for pushing through despite personal setbacks and taking the time for myself to unwind and reflect, which is something I’ve been working on since college started. Having experienced the life of being a researcher for nine weeks, **I have finally decided to apply to graduate schools this cycle.**

What a rollercoaster it has been even for a short amount of time. I hope you enjoyed reading my blog entries for the summer. Onto the next chapter of my life carrying the memories, lessons, and new friends I’ve made…

Yes, you’re reading this because you are my friend - know that I could always say a person is my friend if I get along with them, but you are different. You maybe be asking why? Well, you are not my best friend, which isn’t a bad thing. I feel as though my best friend will be my lifetime partner *(if you know what I mean)*. However, you are my friend *davvero speciale* you are reading this emotional outburst of mine.

As a kid, I struggled determining who my friends are. Instead of feeling good about having friends, I feel pressure bearing the weight of identifying my friendships. It stems back to my experiences of being bullied growing up because of my effeminate characteristics - my movements, my way of speaking, and my sensitivity. Back then, I would cry a lot and feel a lot of emotions. And so every time I have great moments defined by euphoria and sheer love with people who are mostly girls, I reassess whether I should call them friends because society dictates that if you’re friends with girls, you’re one of them - you’re gay. I mean they’re not wrong - I am queer. I just didn’t want to be associated with that term before in a society where queerness is not accepted.

Now that I have recognized such an inner child trauma. I have started trying to heal it. I am writing this letter to tell you how __sorry__ I am for not wholeheartedly being the best friend and how __grateful__ I am to still be considered as one of your friends. You have played a big role on my personal growth in the year/s that we have been together - for real! I genuinely appreciate every moment with you, from our blasting laughters brought by the tiniest things to the deepest, hardest, yet the most fulfilling conversations.

With you, I’ve started to learn how to love platonically, which is hard for a romantic like me. It is indeed one step at a time, but thank you for helping me put my foot in front of the other every time.

Yours truly and sent with *tanto amore*,

Edrian ❤️

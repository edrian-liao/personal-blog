I don’t have many things to say, so I’m keeping this letter brief. We’re not yet a week into this relationship, but I am so happy we decided to continue this rare connection we established in the past 4 weeks. In such a short amount of time, you showed me a type of love that I’ve never seen before, which what makes it more intriguing. I want to explore that love and this connection with you more. 

You feel right too, by the way. With you, I am inspired to be a better person. With this distance, I am more pumped than ever to be in a relationship with you. To make it work, to grow from our flaws, and to put these words I just uttered into action. With you, I act not because I’m scared to lose you; I act because I actually want to be with you—a choice I will never regret no matter what happens.

I am excited in how our new normal is going to unfold. I promise to be honest, communicative, thoughtful, loyal, loving, patient, and caring. I promise to be **IN THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU**. As you said, it’s us against the problems. And we’ll take it one day at a time.

Distance is probably one of the hardest test to couples, but Iyo, I am invested in acing this test with you. And you know me, once I put it in my mind and heart, I’m gonna fight like hell to get it.

Speaking of action, I made this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GKZpO-u1gMjgKeYr8eh23U7XM1dNbXvI?usp=drive_link) for us to at least plan out stuff and keep the connection intimate despite the distance. Feel free to add, remove, and edit.

Most affectionately,
<br>
Your one and only Kin ❤️

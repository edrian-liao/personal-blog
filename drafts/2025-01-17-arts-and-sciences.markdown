During my interview with the Space Enabled Research Group, I was asked by trivial yet broad question, "Why MIT Media Lab?"

# Media Arts and Sciences

Offered by the MIT Media Lab,...

# Design Thinking

# Scientific Process

# Degrees in engineering, the science, and the society

Now it all makes sense, after all, my personal view of engineering just needed a shift, so I can finally say that aside from being a scientist and a social justice advocate, I am an engineer who designs.

In the past few days, majority of my free time was spent thinking about what my life is going to be like in the next decade or so. Don't we all have that ultimate question of whether we want a career that's fulfilling or lucrative? Ideally, we want to have both, but in reality, there's a higher chance of satisfying only one of the two, with hard work and privilege, of course.

In a utopic world, we would not have to choose between the two. I would like to believe that if the society is set up in a certain way where every basic need is not a commodity and beauty and art, things we as humanity strive for, are not exclusive, then we would not have to worry about having a lucrative career. What else would you need money for?

It is a privilege to say that money has not always been an issue for me. My parents, fortunately, are great providers who have worked hard to provide their kids (us) with a comfortable life in the Philippines, despite their growing up from poverty. As a kid growing up in the counryside, my idea of a comfortable is simple relative to what people in Manila or in countries in the West might say: I get to eat three times a day - most of the time, with my mom's delicious homecooked meals that include ingredients from her vegetable garden. I can freely get my homework done and read my academic textbook without worrying about going to the farm to help toil the fields the next day. I have a comfortable bed that lets me sleep for more than 8 hours.
Such a wealthy life!
